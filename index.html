        content="A JavaScript game that requires the player to walk across the board within a time limit and only during when music is playing. I structured the tree of nodes using DOM to add the event listener for elements to play music, start the game, and move around on the board. I incorporated Canvas to render the board for the character to walk across. I ensured the music was playing at a specific time by using asynchronous setTimeOut and setTimeInterval." />
